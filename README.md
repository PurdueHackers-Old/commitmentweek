# [commit]ment week

## The challenge: 
Make at least one commit each day of [commit]ment week to any project on Github. You can work on anything wheter it's a script, tutorial project, school assignment (if allowed), open source tool, etc. 

All projects worked on can also be optionally added to a [Purdue Hackers][Purdue Hackers] [commit]ment week repository as a submodule -- think of this as a reference to another repository (your own in this case) -- so everyone can view one anothers progress! 

[commit]ment week will begin April 10th and end on April 16th. For more info check out the [facebook event][fb].

### Adding your project to the repository 
#### Clone  
```sh
> git clone [git-repo-url] commitmentweek
> cd commitmentweek
```

#### Add your repository as a submodule, add, commit, and push!
```sh
> git submodule add YourRepoURL 
> git add . 
> git commit -m "Adding MyProjectName"
> git push -u origin master
```
